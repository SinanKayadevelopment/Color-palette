# PaletteLab — Summary

PaletteLab is a lightweight, front‑end only color palette tool. It lets you generate 5 random HEX colors, copy any swatch with one click, and save favorites to your browser (LocalStorage). A clean landing page introduces the app; the generator and saved palettes live on separate pages. Tailwind CSS (via CDN) powers the responsive, dark‑mode‑ready UI. No build step, no accounts — just open the HTML files.

## Pages
- index.html: Landing page with CTAs to generator and saved palettes
- generator.html: Random palette generator with copy and save actions
- saved.html: Your saved HEX colors with copy, remove, and clear controls

## Features
- One‑click HEX copy and toast feedback
- Save favorites; persists between sessions (LocalStorage)
- Dark/Light theme with preference persistence
- Responsive layout with accessible focus states

## Quick Start
1) Clone the repo and open index.html in your browser.
2) Use generator.html to create palettes; save what you like.
